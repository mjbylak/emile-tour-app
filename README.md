# Emile's Tour Guide Website
I am creating this React.js website for my friend Emile, who is an Egyptian tour guide I met earlier this year. Recently, Egypt's national currency has hit another massive spike in inflation making it increasingly difficult for families in Egypt to obtain sufficient income to support their families. As a result, tourism is one of the largest industries in Egypt, and there are now over 17,000 tour guides throughout Egypt.

The overcrowding sector forces tour guides to wait days in metaphorical lines for their turn at providing tours within the various agencies they're a part of. As such, it's incredibly helpful for tour guides whent they can find clients on their own.

My plan here is to make a nice, functional website for Emile to find his own customers more easily.
